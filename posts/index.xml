      <description>Well it has been a while since I have done anything in Terraform. My last venture into Terraform was over a year ago when they were on some 0.11.x version, and early beta of 0.12.0 was leaking out. At the time, it didn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be a good fit for what I was trying to do, so I had made the decision to go with writing straight golang code. Since then, it seems some of the hang ups I had with Terraform have been solved.</description>
