<h3 id="christian">Christian</h3>
<p>I am a Christian that attends a non-denominational church. From a theological perspective, I lean towards Calvinist/Reformed, but I have many friends who have different theological views, and still see them as followers of Christ. I believe that several theological points are debatable, except for the gospel message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to
, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://my.bible.com/bible/59/1CO.15.3-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreffer">1 Corinthians 15:3-6</a>
</p>
<p>This is the true gospel message that delivers salvation from our sin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show Godâ€™s righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="family">Family</h3>
<p>I am a happily married man with a family of four children. Two of my children are biological and two of them are soon to be adopted. The experience of fostering and adopting a child has been a wonderful, and character building experience.</p>

<h3 id="devops-engineer">DevOps Engineer</h3>
<p>I am a DevOps engineer by tried. I love coding and automating things! This is very strange to me because when I took coding classes back in college I told my self I would never want to be a developer. Oops! I went to college and studied electrical engineering, but eventually made my way into IT. I started from a service desk position, moved into systems administration and engineering, and finally landed in the DevOps space. I really enjoy solving problems and providing solutions using code! Code All The Things!</p>
